# Marble for Little Navmap

This is a branch of the [Marble](https://marble.kde.org) project that is maintained and stripped down to the bare minimum 
which is just used by [Little Navmap](https://www.littlenavmap.org).

Current branch used by Little Navmap is lnm/1.1 for 3.0 releases. 
lnm/1.2 is current development.
